# Getting Started with Create React App

 [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

eject is irreversible. It's for full control over your project's configuration. Most commands still work, but you're on your own after this. Default features are good for small to medium projects, but feel free to eject when you're ready for customization.
